# Furr Buddies

My Appwrite Hackathon entry, powered by [`Svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## About this App

Furr Buddies is a fully responsive app that focuses on pet owners. It helps manage your dogs, cats, birds, and basically any other pet you may have.

Upon creating a new account and signing in, you can search for available Veterinarians in your area and browse their "home page" for contact details, location, working hours and other useful data.

Once at the Clinic, the Vet can scan your Pet's ID from your phone and have temporal access to update your pet's vaccination information e.tc...

### Additionally


Also, Furr Buddies offers a marketplace for Vendors to sell any pet associated products right from this platform. I call it... `Shop`. ðŸ˜Ž
#
# Technologies

`Furr Buddies` is powered by [`Svelte`](https://svelte.dev), the web framework that I used as my foundation.

[`Appwrite`](https://appwrite.io), the outstanding BaaS that made this such a breeze to achieve.

[`SkeletonUI`](https://skeleton.dev) was hands down the best and most sensible UI framework to use.

Another necessary mention here is `svelte-forms`, `svelte-french-toast` and the most obvious ofcourse... `Microsoft` for Windows, Terminal, and VScode, lol.

## Installing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
